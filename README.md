# BOG.ShowMeTheFolders

Simply enumerates the value of the special folders on the host computer to its console.

Determines the concrete answer for each enumeration on the running computer.  The list with values are displayed
first, followed by a list of those special folders with no value defined.

Note: This is a .NET app reporting what it sees on the host where it executes, be it Windows, OSX or Linux.
On Linux, the item values will vary depending on the Linux version and release.  I used this to determine
how the various Linux versions are implementing the values, to determine a folder strategy.

I hope someone else finds it useful.

v1.0.0 -- first (and only version)
